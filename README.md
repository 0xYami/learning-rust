# learning-rust


I decided to learn [rust](https://rust-lang.org) because I feel like I would like it.

I have made [one](https://git.hylia.dev/Reddit-Bot) project with [rust](https://rust-lang.org).

## Running The Executeables


To run the Executeables you must have [rust](https://rust-lang.org) installed on your system.

```shell
> ./learn.sh
```


I'm excited to embark on this journey to learn Rust, and I hope this repository can help others who are also on a similar path. If you have any suggestions, improvements, or would like to contribute, please feel free to open an issue or create a pull request.
